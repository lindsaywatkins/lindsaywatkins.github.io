	<h2>More About Us</h2>

	<p>Lauren Lasky is the founder of Perpetual Motion Adventures, and the person youâ€™re mostly likely to reach when you contact us.</p>

	<p>Over the past twenty years, Lauren has held various roles in the outdoor industry, specializing in marketing, sales, and product development. After spending the last decade working as a travel consultant for European bike touring, Lauren realized a need to have a broader range of tours to offer to clients. It was then that she started researching the companies that she now represents at Perpetual Motion Adventures.</p>
